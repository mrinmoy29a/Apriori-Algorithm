# Apriori-Algorithm
A python2 implementation of Apriori algorithm for mining frequent patterns from datasets.

## Instructions
You can run the script directly from command line.

     python apriori.py filename minsupport minconfidence
     
Or you will be prompted to send inputs from interface.

## Apriori
An overview of Association Rule Mining can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_rule_learning

The example dataset chess.dat was taken from http://fimi.ua.ac.be/. More datasets can be found here.

Based on the paper [Fast algorithms for mining association rules](http://www.cse.msu.edu/~cse960/Papers/MiningAssoc-AgrawalAS-VLDB94.pdf) by Rakesh Agrawal and Ramakrishnan Srikant.
